The Number is Kaprekar or not
Write a program to find the given number is kaprekar or not. A number if kaprekar if the representation of its square can be split into two parts that add up to the original number. For instance, 45 is a Kaprekar number, because 45^2 = 2025 and 20 + 25 = 45. Whereas 13 is not as 13^2 = 169 which can be split in two ways (1+69) and (16+9), but any of them is not 13. The number 1 is Kaprekar, because 1^2 = 01, and  0 + 1 = 1.

Output

For each input case, print 1 if number is kaprekar and print 0 otherwise.
